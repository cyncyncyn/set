Set, the game of visual perception - From JS to Python!

When I was learning to code I was asked to do a game in JavaScript as a final exam. I choosed SET, http://www.setgame.com/

It is kind of archaic, pure js, no jQuery or other frameworks were allowed. I also didn't have any idea what an object was in that .

I made the cards with Illustrator by coping them one by one from the ones I have physically at home.

This is our try to make a Python version!
